  <h2 id="headline">7 things you  wanted to know about Nigel Thornberry but were too afraid to ask:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <h4 id="question">Who is he?</h4>
Sir Nigel Archibald Thornberry, KBE is the host and creator of the nature docuseries "Nigel Thornberry's Wild World" which he co-produces with his wife Marianne, who films and edits the show.<br>
Nigel is a humble man who prefers to simply be called "Nigel" even after recieving his knighthood from the late Queen Elizabeth II: </li> <br>

<li> <h4 id="question">
  Is he a family man? </h4>
Yes. Nigel is a devoted husband to Marianne and a loving father to Debbie and Eliza. His love and genorosity knows no bounds and there was no question in Nigel's mind to adpot a small feral child when he came across him in the wilderness, turning their family of 4 into a family of 5 when he adpoted Donnie.<br>
Loving animals is second nature to Nigel and while some may find a chimpanzee an unorthodox pet to have, Nigel considers Darwin the chimp just as much a part of the family as his own children.
Despite his dedication to his work he always puts his family first and will go to great lengths to protect them: </li><br>

<li> <h4 id="question"> How much does he really know about animals? </h4>
Nigel is an expert in his field and was even offered a professorship at the prestigious University of Oxford, however after careful consideration Nigel respectfully declined this offer. 
<br> His numerous qualifications and awards are a credit to the years of dedication he has poured into his passion for the natural world - but watch this clip below and see the master at work to truly answer your question:</li><br>

<li><h4 id="question">
  How does he DO it? </h4>
  Nigel is a man of many talents and there is no singular reason to attribute to him gaining his many accomplishments.<br>
  However, Nigel has always found that when he looks at the world through the animals' eyes then he is able to see so much more:

<li> <h4 id="question">If Nigel is so dedicated to his work, does he ever have time for fun? </h4>
Nigel absolutely loves his work and not only does he consider it a privilege but a joy to be a part of that he enjoys everyday. <br>
His enthusiasm for his work always shines through but he is no stranger to a little bit of silliness - as this clip of Nigel on set beautifully illustrates:

  <li> <h4 id="question">Does Nigel have any flaws?! </h4>
  Nigel may be an exceptionally bright, educated, generous, and charming individual. However, he is human and to be human is to err. 
  Nigel is not afraid to make mistakes and knows that his family is always there to support him: </li>

<li> <h4 id="question"> Is there any way that I can be Nigel? </h4>
It's a great question to have with a goal that many of us strive to attain. <br>
For this one I'll just hand over to the man himself and let him show you a tip for something you can do whenever you're trying to be a little more Nigel:
